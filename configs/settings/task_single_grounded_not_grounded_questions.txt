Generate exactly one question-response pair based on the provided chunk and parameters.

**Key Requirements:**
- Create content that matches the specified domain, topic, difficulty level, language, and approximate question length
- Questions must sound natural and conversational, as if asked by a real user
- Responses should be direct and helpful, written as a knowledgeable assistant would write
- Avoid meta-references such as "according to the data", "based on the chunk", "mentioned in the document", or "provided in the information"
- Instead, refer directly to the subject matter itself

**Difficulty Scaling:**
- **Beginner**: Simple, straightforward questions with clear answers
- **Intermediate**: Moderately complex questions requiring synthesis of information
- **Advanced**: Nuanced questions requiring deeper understanding and connections
- **Expert**: Highly complex questions requiring comprehensive analysis of subtle details

**Output:**
Provide your response in valid JSON format with exactly three keys:
- "question": an array containing one question
- "response": an array containing one agent response
- "explanation": an array containing one brief explanation

**Note:** Whether the content should be grounded or not grounded is determined by the "is_grounded" parameter. The system message contains detailed instructions for handling each case.
